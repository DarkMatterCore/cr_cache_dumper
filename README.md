# cr_cache_dumper

Experimental Nintendo Switch homebrew application capable of dumping data from Crunchyroll's cache storages.

The Title ID is hardcoded to `0100C090153B4000`. This could theoretically be used to dump data cache storages belonging to other apps if the Title ID is modified.

Output files are saved to `sdmc:/cache_dumps/<title_id>/<cache_index>/`.
